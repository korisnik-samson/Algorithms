# Java Data Structures and Algorithms

This repository contains implementations of common data structures and algorithms in Java, all built using a custom `Node` class.

## Data Structures

### SingleLinkedList

A singly linked list implementation with the following operations:

### DoubleLinkedList

A doubly linked list implementation (implementation pending). This will include similar operations to the `SingleLinkedList` but with the added advantage of bi-directional traversal.

### ***The Single and Double Linked Lists implement an interface Lists***

## Algorithms

This repository also includes implementations of various algorithms, including:

- **Sorting Algorithms:**
    - Bubble Sort
    - Insertion Sort
    - Merge Sort
    - Quick Sort
    - Selection Sort
- **Graph Algorithms:**
    - Breadth-First Traversal
    - Depth-First Traversal
- **Other Data Structures:**
    - Queue
    - Deque
    - Stack
    - Binary Tree


## Usage

To use these data structures and algorithms, simply clone the repository and include the relevant Java files in your project.

```bash
git clone [repository_url](https://github.com/korisnik-samson/Algorithms.git)
