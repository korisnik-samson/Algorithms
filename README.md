# Java Data Structures and Algorithms

This repository contains implementations of common data structures and algorithms in Java, all built using a custom `Node` class.

## Data Structures

### SingleLinkedList

A singly linked list implementation with the following operations:

- `addFirst(E data)`: Adds a new node with the given data to the beginning of the list.
- `addLast(E data)`: Adds a new node with the given data to the end of the list.
- `add(int index, E data)`: Adds a new node with the given data at the specified index.
- `removeFirst()` : Removes the first node from the list and returns its data.
- `removeLast()` : Removes the last node from the list and returns its data.
- `remove(int index)` : Removes the node at the specified index and returns its data.
- `get(int index)` : Returns the data of the node at the specified index.
- `contains(E data)` : Checks if the list contains a node with the given data.
- `size()` : Returns the number of nodes in the list.
- `isEmpty()` : Checks if the list is empty.
- `printList()` : Prints the data of all nodes in the list.

### DoubleLinkedList

A doubly linked list implementation (implementation pending). This will include similar operations to the `SingleLinkedList` but with the added advantage of bi-directional traversal.

## Algorithms

This repository also includes implementations of various algorithms, including:

- **Sorting Algorithms:**
    - Bubble Sort
    - Insertion Sort
    - Merge Sort
    - Quick Sort
    - Selection Sort
- **Graph Algorithms:**
    - Breadth-First Traversal
    - Depth-First Traversal
- **Other Data Structures:**
    - Queue
    - Deque
    - Stack
    - Binary Tree


## Usage

To use these data structures and algorithms, simply clone the repository and include the relevant Java files in your project.

```bash
git clone [invalid URL removed]
